This movie was awesome, and I think it can stand as a testimonial piece towards the capabilities that Christopher Pratt has. He nailed it. The graphics were awesome, the supporting cast did great and the t rex saved the child in me. 10\\5 stars, four thumbs up, and I hope that star wars episode VII doesn't disappoint,"
